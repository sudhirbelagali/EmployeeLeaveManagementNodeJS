Employee Leave Management Using NodeJS - ExpressJS with HandleBars
Beginner level application project - created using NodeJs NPM packages 
It uses mysql as backend to store the information of employees and their leaves details as well.
I had it deployed ontop of heroku also but later it threw many errors when I added mysql the nodejs application project.
As heroku support clearDB mysql version. But we have to enable billing also, so couldnt do that.
